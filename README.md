# Vehicle Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of vehicle listings in the US. It includes various visualizations to explore the data, such as histograms and scatter plots. The project is implemented using Python with the Pandas, Streamlit, and Plotly Express libraries.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about vehicles listed for sale in the US. It includes details such as price, model year, manufacturer, model, condition, odometer reading, transmission type, vehicle type, paint color, and other attributes.

## Features
- Display the dataset: Users can choose to display the dataset to see all the available columns and rows.
- Visualizations: The application provides histograms and scatter plots to explore the distribution and relationships between various attributes in the dataset.
- Comparison: Users can compare vehicle brands with their associated types or fuel types using bar charts.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python: Programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
- Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- Streamlit: Framework for building interactive web applications.
- Plotly Express: Library for creating interactive plots and visualizations.

## Files
- `app.py`: This is the main Python script that contains the Streamlit web application code.
- `vehicles_us.csv`: This is the dataset file containing the vehicle listings.
- `README.txt`: This file provides an overview of the project, instructions for running the application, and information about the dataset and tools used.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit application by executing `streamlit run app.py` in your terminal.
4. Explore the various visualizations and analyses provided in the web application.

## Future Work
- Add more interactive features and customization options to the visualizations.
- Incorporate additional data sources to enrich the analysis.
- Explore advanced statistical analysis and machine learning techniques for deeper insights into the dataset.

Note : Thank you for your feedback. I did not tought about creating a function. After that everything looked little less confusing. To be honest, my creation got clogged when it comes to being creative with comparision and all. I cant really think of any other comparision. I tried to create a new colum with Make only, which i wanted to seperate Make from model. I messed it up, that will be my next task!

Note V2 : I also updated the EDA file in notebooks. Everything is the same as app.py Thank you
Best,
